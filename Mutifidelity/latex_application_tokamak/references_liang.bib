               measure on separable Banach and Hilbert spaces, as required
               later; they assume a reasonable background in probability theory

               devoted to the existence and uniqueness of solutions of a
               general stochastic evolution equation, and the third concerns
               the qualitative properties of those solutions. Appendices gather

abstract = {Abstract The adaptation of the high-recycling divertor concept for ITER is not possible because, owing to the increase in fusion power to 1.5 GW, the resulting loads on the divertor target plates are in excess of 35 MW m−2. Therefore a novel concept is proposed, based on observations of power reduction by about one order of magnitude in existing tokamaks at high-density operation. It will allow for a viable approach to the problems of energy and particle exhaust, helium pumping and impurity control at an adequate lifetime of the divertor. The concept is based on radiation and momentum exhaust along the divertor channel, and relies on the fact that a substantial fraction of the incoming power can be radiated as long as the plasma pressure is balanced not only by plasma and neutral particles in front of the target plates but also dynamically by high fluxes of recycling particles. Therefore this operating regime is called the dynamic gas target divertor. This paper describes the design and the development of the ITER divertor and shows how the physics requirements have been translated into engineering solutions, and how the additionally existing constraints (such as the space limitations, neutron effects, electromagnetic loads, compatibility with other components, easy maintainability, etc.) have been taken into account.}

The combination of finite element methods (FEM) and boundary element methods (BEM) is the obvious instrument, and we adapt here for the first time the two standard FEM-BEM coupling approaches to the free-boundary equilibrium problem: the Johnson–Nédélec coupling and the Bielak–MacCamy coupling. We recall also the classical approach for fusion applications, dubbed according to its first appearance von-Hagenow–Lackner coupling and present the less used alternative introduced by Albanese, Blum and de Barbieri in [2]. We show that the von-Hagenow–Lackner coupling suffers from undesirable non-optimal convergence properties, that suggest that other coupling schemes, in particular Johnson–Nédélec or Albanese–Blum–de Barbieri are more appropriate for non-linear equilibrium problems. Moreover, we show that any of such coupling methods requires Newton-like iteration schemes for solving the corresponding non-linear discrete algebraic systems."

As a model we consider a nonlinear second order elliptic equation in divergence form in a bounded inner region of the plane, which becomes the Laplace equation in the corresponding unbounded exterior region. We provide sufficient conditions for the nonlinear coefficients from which existence, uniqueness, and approximation results are established. In particular, nonlinear equations yielding both monotone and nonmonotone operators are analyzed.",

abstractNote={Solutions of the equilibrium equations of a perfectly conducting fluid (1) div B = 0, grad p = J x B = curl B x B/u are corsidered.  The special case p = constant is a force-free field. These equations are formally identical to those of incompressible fluid flow if B is identified with the fluid velocity and -p with the Bernoulli constant. The solutions of (1) are described by formulating initial and boundary value problems, by integrating the equations in terms of arbitrary functions, and by showing the equivalence with a variational formulation. The situation is complicated by the nonlinearity of the equations. First, one can compute the characteristic normals which are four in number (the system is essentially fourth order). The magnetic lines (analoguestream lines) are counted twice and there are two pure imaginary roots as for the potential equation. On this basis a number of existence theorems are conjectured (and in some special cases proved). (auth)},

abstract = "Existing finite element implementations for the computation of free-boundary axisymmetric plasma equilibria approximate the unknown poloidal flux function by standard lowest order continuous finite elements with discontinuous gradients. As a consequence, the location of critical points of the poloidal flux, that are of paramount importance in tokamak engineering, is constrained to nodes of the mesh leading to undesired jumps in transient problems. Moreover, recent numerical results for the self-consistent coupling of equilibrium with resistive diffusion and transport suggest the necessity of higher regularity when approximating the flux map. In this work we propose a mortar element method that employs two overlapping meshes. One mesh with Cartesian quadrilaterals covers the vacuum chamber domain accessible by the plasma and one mesh with triangles discretizes the region outside. The two meshes overlap in a narrow region. This approach gives the flexibility to achieve easily and at low cost higher order regularity for the approximation of the flux function in the domain covered by the plasma, while preserving accurate meshing of the geometric details outside this region. The continuity of the numerical solution in the region of overlap is weakly enforced by a mortar-like mapping."

    abstract = { 1. The process which it is the object of this Essay to establish, being nothing else than the leading theorem in the Calculus of Derivations, presented under a new aspect, may be regarded as a universal instrument of calculation, extending to the composition as well as analysis of functions of every kind. But it comes into most useful application in the numerical solution of equations. 2. Arbogast’s developement of ϕ ( α + βx + γx2 + δx3 + ∈x4 + .... ) (See Calc, des Der. § 33 ) supposes all the coefficients within the parenthesis to be known previously to the operation of ϕ. To the important cases in which the discovery of γ, δ, \&amp;c. depends on the previous developement of the partial functions ϕ ( α + βx ), ϕ ( α + βx + γx2), \&amp;c. }

Emphasis will be placed on the variational formulations of the boundary integral equations and the general error estimates for the approximate solution in appropriate Sobolev spaces. A classification of boundary integral equations will be given on the basis of the Sobolev index. The simple relations between the variational formulations of the boundary integral equations and the corresponding partial differential equations under consideration will be indicated. Basic concepts such as stability, consistency, and convergence, as well as the condition numbers and ill-posedness, will be discussed by using elementary examples.}

Let $\Gamma_2$ be the common boundary of $\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2 = \Omega^c - \Omega_1$. We solve the problem (1) by using an equivalent system of equations involving an integral equation on $\Gamma_2$ coupled with the equation: \begin{equation*}\tag{2} \begin{cases}\Delta u = f\quad \text{ in } \Omega_1, \\ u\mid_\Gamma = u_0, \\ u\mid_{\Gamma_2} = \lambda.\end{cases}\end{equation*} We introduce a finite element approximation of Eq.

	journal = {Nuclear Fusion},
	abstract = {Techniques are presented for determining the MHD equilibrium configuration for circular and non-circular plasmas from measurements of the magnetic field and flux made outside the discharge. Least-squares minimization techniques are introduced to provide an objective means for comparing the experimental data with the corresponding calculated equilibrium and for error estimation. Free-boundary equilibria using a simple model for the plasma-current profile with three free parameters – total current, poloidal beta, and a single parameter describing the peakedness of the current profile – are found to be statistically adequate and sufficient to describe the magnetic configuration of the discharge. In plasmas with significant non-circularity, the Shafranov dimensionless inductance, ℓi, can be determined independent of βp. Examples of the application of the technique to discharges in the Doublet-Ill tokamak are presented.}

	journal = {Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion},
	abstract = {An analytic form to describe the boundary of an axisymmetric plasma is proposed. This new form uses a generalization of the family of superellipses. The plasma boundaries of existing tokamaks are well described using the compact notation. The form employs eleven parameters of which five are standard, two are generalizations of a standard parameter and four are introduced here. With these same parameters, a closed-form analytic solution can be used to generate new boundaries without x-points. If the desired boundary has x-points, the analytic form can be extended in a manner for which a closed-form solution has not been found, but does have an exact solution that can be found numerically. This new form should be useful for variety of physics studies that use magnetohydrodynamic equilibria, such as the dependence of plasma stability on shape and design of poloidal field coil sets that can support a defined range of shapes.}

abstract = {In axisymmetric fusion reactors, the equilibrium magnetic configuration can be expressed in terms of the solution to a semi-linear elliptic equation known as the Grad–Shafranov equation, the solution of which determines the poloidal component of the magnetic field. When the geometry of the confinement region is known, the problem becomes an interior Dirichlet boundary value problem. We propose a high order solver based on the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin method. The resulting algorithm (1) provides high order of convergence for the flux function and its gradient, (2) incorporates a novel method for handling piecewise smooth geometries by extension from polygonal meshes, (3) can handle geometries with non-smooth boundaries and x-points, and (4) deals with the semi-linearity through an accelerated two-grid fixed-point iteration. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified with computations for cases where analytic solutions are known on configurations similar to those of actual devices (ITER with single null and double null divertor, NSTX, ASDEX upgrade, and Field Reversed Configurations).},

abstract = {Abstract This is the first of two papers concerning superconvergent recovery techniques and a posteriori error estimation. In this paper, a general recovery technique is developed for determining the derivatives (stresses) of the finite element solutions at nodes. The implementation of the recovery technique is simple and cost effective. The technique has been tested for a group of widely used linear, quadratic and cubic elements for both one and two dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the recovered nodal values of the derivatives with linear and cubic elements are superconvergent. One order higher accuracy is achieved by the procedure with linear and cubic elements but two order higher accuracy is achieved for the derivatives with quadratic elements. In particular, an O(h4) convergence of the nodal values of the derivatives for a quadratic triangular element is reported for the first time. The performance of the proposed technique is compared with the widely used smoothing procedure of global L2 projection and other methods. It is found that the derivatives recovered at interelement nodes, by using L2 projection, are also superconvergent for linear elements but not for quadratic elements. Numerical experiments on the convergence of the recovered solutions in the energy norm are also presented. Higher rates of convergence are again observed. The results presented in this part of the paper indicate clearly that a new, powerful and economical process is now available which should supersede the currently used post-processing procedures applied in most codes.},

abstract = {Abstract In this second part of the paper, the issue of a posteriori error estimation is discussed. In particular, we derive a theorem showing the dependence of the effectivity index for the Zienkiewicz–Zhu error estimator on the convergence rate of the recovered solution. This shows that with superconvergent recovery the effectivity index tends asymptotically to unity. The superconvergent recovery technique developed in the first part of the paper1 is the used in the computation of the Zienkiewicz–Zhu error estimator to demonstrate accurate estimation of the exact error attainable. Numerical tests are shown for various element types illustrating the excellent effectivity of the error estimator in the energy norm and pointwise gradient (stress) error estimation. Several examples of the performance of the error estimator in adaptive mesh refinement are also presented.},
