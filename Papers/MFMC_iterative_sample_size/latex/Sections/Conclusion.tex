This paper introduced a novel iterative framework for integer-valued sample size allocation in multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimation, bridging the gap between continuous optimal formulations and discrete practical implementations. Grounded in dynamic programming and Bellman’s principle of optimality, the method reformulates sample allocation as a sequential decision process that enforces integer constraints while ensuring strict budget adherence. The proposed iterative formulation preserves the variance–cost optimality of MFMC while extending its applicability to discrete settings. Compared with conventional rounding and modified flooring techniques, it achieves near-perfect budget utilization and superior statistical efficiency. With linear computational complexity and a recursive structure, the algorithm is particularly suited for high-dimensional fidelity hierarchies and resource-limited environments.

Overall, the framework offers a principled and efficient approach to multifidelity resource allocation. Its combination of theoretical rigor, algorithmic simplicity, and robust performance provides a solid foundation for future developments in multifidelity Monte Carlo methods and uncertainty quantification.
