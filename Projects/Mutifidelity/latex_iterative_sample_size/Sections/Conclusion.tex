\section{Conclusion}
% ====================================================
This paper has introduced a novel iterative framework for integer-valued sample size allocation in multi-fidelity Monte Carlo estimation, addressing a critical implementation gap between theoretical continuous optima and practical discrete requirements. Through a formulation grounded in dynamic programming principles and Bellman's principle of optimality, we have developed a sequential allocation scheme that preserves the theoretical foundations of MFMC estimation while enforcing integer constraints and maintaining strict budget adherence. From a practical perspective, the algorithm's linear computational complexity and sequential decision-making structure make it particularly suitable for high-dimensional fidelity hierarchies and resource-constrained environments. 

The proposed method demonstrates significant advantages over conventional approaches: it reduces the budget under-utilization inherent in direct flooring strategies, and achieves superior variance characteristics compared to existing modified rounding procedures.
